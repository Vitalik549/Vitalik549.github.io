Answer following questions: 
- what do you want to automate? testing of a website, backend logic, application performance, desktop application, mobile app, all that? or just script some staff to reduce manual work?
-- choose set of tools, programming language/integrated solution that allows to test that
- do you really need automation? 
-- would you get any profit (ROI) by automating that? probably that could be done manually (or half-automated) in reasonable amount of time. Don't over-engineer.
- what resources do you have? time/people/money/soft/tools/...
-- 

Tests:
- how many tests do you expect to have?
-- is that solution scalable enough to support that amount of tests?
- how many people will work with automation solution?
-- does your solution work fine with that amount of concurrent users? how will you store/distribute code among that people?
- how your tests expected to run?
-- do you want to run tests manually or automatically? Could/Should your solution be integrated into CI pipeline? 
-- Locally or on a remote machine? 
- on what environment will you run tests? dev server / prod / local server
-- define level of security, possibility to modify/remove data, risks of unintentional data loss on that env. You do not want to erase your producation database =) 


- what levels of tests you want to run? unit, integration, e2e? 
-- split tests on proper suites
- define max time that your test job should run
-- limit yourself to get fast response 
- how frequently?
-- again, fast response
- what is the goal of your automation?
-- verify quality, regression testing, report managers, inform developers, reduce manual activities?
